        <li> Korean</li> 
            <p> I want to visit Korea because it is like a real-life K-drama! I can't wait to explore ancient palaces, munch on all the kimchi I can handle, and maybe even find my own handsome oppa! Plus, I am ready to unleash my inner dance star with some K-pop moves (just do not film it!). It sounds like the perfect adventure!</p>

        <li> Amsterdam</li>     
            <p> I want to visit Amsterdam because it is s like stepping into a painting! I can not wait to bike through the charming canals, try all the stroopwafels, and maybe get lost in a museum or two (or three!). Plus, I hear the tulips are basically nature is confetti, and who would not want to celebrate with that? It sounds like a dreamy adventure!</p>

            <p> I want to visit Wales because it feels like a fairy tale come to life! I can't wait to explore the stunning castles, hike through the breathtaking hills, and maybe even spot a dragon (or at least a sheep). Plus, the idea of cozying up with some traditional Welsh cakes sounds like the perfect way to recharge after an adventure. It’s like a magical adventure waiting to happen!</p>

        <li> French </li> 
            <p> I want to visit France because it feels like living in a romantic movie! I can't wait to stroll along the Seine, munch on fresh croissants, and practice my "bonjour" skills (which might be more “bonjourrr”!). Plus, exploring all the art, fashion, and charming cafés sounds like a dream come true. It’s the ultimate adventure for a daydreamer like me!</p>

        I consider myself an advanturous and culturally curious traveller.I love exploring new places that offer a unique combination of natural beauty, history, and vibrant modern life. From wandering through ancient temples and castles to enjoying the buzz of big cities, my goal is to experience both the traditions and the heart of a place. Whether it's trying new foods, learning a few words in the local language, or diving into the arts and culture, I always look for opportunities to immerse myself in new experiences. For me, travel is about discovery and creating unforgettable memories!
